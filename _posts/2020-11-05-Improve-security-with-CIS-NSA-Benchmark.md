Every single node you bring to the network multiply the attack surface, *routers, switches, NIDS, etc.…* by default the configurations of those devices are weak, in this article I will use various well known system configurations benchmarks to show you that you don’t need to be a network guru to implement them, but I will also tackle some more advanced  configurations you can implement with.<!--more-->

Before we go further, let's take a look at [The Center for Internet Security (CIS) top 18 CIS Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/) (previously known as the **SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls)**, for the sake of this post we will focus only on the  **Basic CIS Controls**, because having those implemented is already a great step forward. 


#### CIS Basic Controls

- Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets
- Iventory and Control of Software Assets
- Continuous Vulnerability Management
- Controlled Use of Administration Privileges
- Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software
- Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs
